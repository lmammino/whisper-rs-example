# Whisper-rs speech-to-text example

An example of how to use [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) [bindings for Rust](https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs) to perform speech-to-text.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Download and install your preferred Whisper models](#download-and-install-whisper-models)
- [Provide some sample audio files](#provide-sample-audio-files)

### Download and install Whisper models

In order to run this example, you need to download and install the Whisper models.

Detailed instructions on the best way to do that can be found in the [Whisper.cpp README](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/models/README.md).


### Provide sample audio files

Sample audio files can be placed in the `./samples` folder.

Audio files need to be **mono 16bit Wav** files.

You can use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert your audio/video files to this format:

```bash
ffmpeg -i <source_file> -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le <target_file>
```

Note: make sure to replace `<source_file>` and `<target_file>` with the appropriate paths

- [UCL London - DIVISION OF PSYCHOLOGY AND LANGUAGE SCIENCES - sample audio files](https://www.uclass.psychol.ucl.ac.uk/Release2/Conversation/AudioOnly/wav/)



## Build and run

```bash
cargo +nightly run --release -- <path_to_audio_file> [path_to_model]
```

Where:

- `path_to_audio_file` - path to a **mono 16bit Wav** audio file to be transcribed, for example `./samples/whisper_demo_16k.wav`.
- `path_to_model` - path to the folder containing the model files, for example `./models/en_16k`. If not provided, it will try to load the first `.bin` file found in the `./models` folder.
